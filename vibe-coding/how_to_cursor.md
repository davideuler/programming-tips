Always create two file:
project-name.md
.cursorrules

$ cat .cursorrules
```
# IMPORTANT:  

# Always read [project-name].md before writing any code.

# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update [project-name].md.

# Document the entire database schema in [project-name].md.

# For new migrations, make sure to add them to the same file.
